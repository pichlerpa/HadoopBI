In this project, has been redesigned the WideWorldImporters sample data warehouse inlcuding the SSIS package in Hadoop (HDInsight). The corresponding Azure SQL sample database has served as the main data source. Further, there is included a Phyton script that enhances the solution with data coming from the Twitter API. The project comprises files and source code of Sqoop, Hive, Oozie and Python.
